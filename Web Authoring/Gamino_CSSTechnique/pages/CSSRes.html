                    <dd>This website is a help where it shows you exactly what you are looking for in different types of categories depending on what you need, it also has all the languages ​​you need to search, it is a complete website in my opinion.</dd>

                    <dd>This page is my second choice for research when I'm looking for something new or just a reminder of how to use it, it is a website that specializes in the languages ​​of building a web page (HTML, CSS and JavaScript).</dd>

                    <dt>web.dev</dt>
                    <dd>I like this website because it has an order of how to progress with CSS, although it also divides the CSS categories into each section.</dd>

                    <dt>TutorialPoint</dt>
                    <dd>I would say that this page is a copy of W3Schools just as it has examples of each programming language and its variety of examples and choices that it offers you, I could say that it is the same and I would leave it as a last option or a spare.</dd>
