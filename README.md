Hello everybody, I am Luis Gamino

These hands-on experiences have strengthened my problem-solving skills and deepened my enthusiasm for IT.

I enjoy experimenting with emerging technologies, both in hardware and software, to understand how things work and push the boundaries of innovation. Whether it's fixing a printer, optimizing code, or developing a web application, I see every challenge as an opportunity to grow.
